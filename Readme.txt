This Software was designed to facilitate a research and development project which was developing new winding materials
for the motor industry. The temperature of the material placed in an oven was to be monitored over a period
of time as stresses were applied.
An Arduino was used to provide the temperature sensor interface for the Desktop Application written in C# on a WinForms App.
The Desktop Application was also responsible for sending data from each test performed to the Cloud
from where the data could be viewed at a later date on a Web Browser Application.
The Cloud Server was implemented using Python Flask and the Web Application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.
